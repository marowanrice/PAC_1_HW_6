# PAC_1_HW_6
converts int to binary and hexadecimal

GRADE: 10/10

This assignment asks you to write a Java class called SmallInt (similar to a wrapper class). It also asks you to create a
testing class called TestSmallInt. You will need to turn in both for your submission.

Write an instance getter method getBin (returns a String, takes no parameters) should take the number stored in the instance
variable value, generate the corresponding binary string and return that string.

Write an instance getter method getHex (returns a String, takes no parameters) should take the number stored in the instance
variable value, generate the corresponding hexadecimal string and return that string.
